## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/Rocketry Headshot.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am Propulsion Subteam Co-Lead at Cornell Rocketry Team, focusing on the end-to-end design of fluid systems for flight vehicles, including mechanically actuated valves and quick disconnects. I am proficient in SolidWorks for CAD modeling and ANSYS Static Structural for performance verification. I am also responsible for enhancing integration reliability for hybrid and liquid motor R&D campaigns.

I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, with hands-on experience in FEA, mechanical design, and rapid prototyping. A recent internship I partook in at MITRE involved contributing to drone capability development through aerodynamic analysis, CAD optimization, and prototype design. I am passionate about advancing aerospace systems design through innovation and precision engineering.
