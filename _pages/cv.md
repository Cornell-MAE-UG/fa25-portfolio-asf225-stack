#### Engineering Experience
- **Mechanical Reliability and Prototyping Intern at MITRE**  
  May, 2025 - July, 2025
  - Owned design and analysis tasks for drone capability development, contributing to their unmanned aerial systemsprogram
  - Redesigned and optimized legacy drone CAD models in SolidWorks to improve ease of assembly and disassembly, reducing turnaround time for prototyping and field testing
  - Performed CFD drag analysis to assess aerodynamic performance, then parameterized the CAD to enable streamlined future optimization and iteration
  - Developed an in-air drone deployment mechanism, applying CAD and prototyping tools to improve mission flexibility; the system conserved battery life and expanded potential launch environments.  
- **Propulsion Co-Lead at Cornell Rocketry Team**  
  May, 2025 - Current
  - Owning the end-to-end design of the flight vehicle fluid system, including a mechanically actuated valve (MAV) and quick disconnect (QD) for nitrous oxide fill and release
  - Applying SolidWorks for CAD modeling of components, used ANSYS Static Structural to verify MAV performance under high-pressure flow, and ran trade studies to optimize system layout
  - Improving flow efficiency and integration reliability across the full system—from fill station to rocket—while managing project logistics, timelines, and subsystem coordination for the 2026 hybrid and liquid motor R&D campaigns 
- **Propulsion Sub-team Member at Cornell Rocketry Team**  
  Oct, 2023 - May, 2025
  - Solely owned the mechanically actuated valve (MAV) design, from ideation and product selection through iterative CAD modeling, static structural analysis, hardware fabrication, and full integration into the flight vehicle
  - Used SolidWorks for iterative CAD design of MAV components, balancing strict mass and spatial constraints with manufacturability; accounted for CNC machining limitations and produced custom mounts for gear, ball valve, and servo
  - Created and 3D-printed battery and pull-pin mounts tailored to the MAV geometry, ensuring robust and lightweight integration
  - Applied static structural analysis in ANSYS to confirm MAV stability under high-pressure nitrous oxide flow, then coordinated with electrical and structures sub-teams to achieve seamless system compatibility
  - Supported assembly and pressure testing of the full fluid system, culminating in a successful hybrid rocket launch to 12,100 ft with a motor burn thrust of 1,385 lbf, validating the MAV’s performance at flight scale

#### Projects
- **Blade Leading Edge Erosion (BLEE) Lab Member**    
  - 3D mapping the severity of erosion on a wind turbine blade to analyze the damage in ANSYS
  - Determining cost effective, aerodynamic, and easily applicable methods to reduce BLEE  

- **Tripoli High-Power Rocketry Certifications (Level 1, 2, and 3)**    
  - Successfully earned Tripoli Level 1 Certification by constructing and launching a high-power rocket with an H motor, achieving ~2000 ft altitude while meeting all stability, recovery, and safety requirements
  - Progressed to Level 2 and 3 certifications, designing and building increasingly complex high-powered rockets capable of housing motors with impulses ranging from 640 Ns to over 5000 Ns
  - Designed and integrated an avionics bay with altimeter and dual-deployment recovery system, enabling precise sequencing of drogue and main parachutes
  - Selected a fiberglass airframe for the Level 3 rocket to provide both structural resilience and uninterrupted GPS signal transmission through the rocket body, critical for real-time flight tracking
  - Used OpenRocket simulations to model flight dynamics, optimize stability margins, and verify deployment altitude parameters prior to launch
