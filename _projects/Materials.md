For my final project in my Mechanics of Materials class, I was tasked to design a non-ratcheting 3/8-inch drive instrumented torque wrench rated for 600 in-lbf. The goal was to integrate strain gauges at high-strain regions to transduce torque while meeting strict performance and safety criteria. The assignment combined analytical hand calculations with finite element analysis (FEA) in ANSYS: first valdating the calculations using a provided baseline model, then iterating my own design by evaluating stress, strain, material selection, and geometry. I developed a CAD model informed by my analytical work, imported it into ANSYS for stress and deformation analysis, and verified that the final design satisfied sensitivity, yield, fracture, and fatigue requirements. This project strengthened my ability to perform first-cut mechanical designs under multiple constraints and to  compare hand-calculated predictions with FEM results.
