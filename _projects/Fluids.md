For this project, my team and I fully dissected a chainsaw by taking it apart and identifying every component relevant to its fluid-mechanical operation. We traced how air, fuel, and lubrication oil move through the system and examined the principles that govern each flow path—from pressure-driven intake and carburetor mixing to two-stroke engine function , flywheel-induced airflow, and rotation-driven oil delivery. By analyzing the geometry and function of parts such as the carburetor, flywheel, piston, clutch, and oil pump, we connected real mechanical hardware to core fluid-mechanics concepts. This work combined hands-on mechanical disassembly with theoretical analysis, giving me practical insight into how compact machines integrate multiple fluid systems to operate efficiently.
