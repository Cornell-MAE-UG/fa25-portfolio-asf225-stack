I successfully completed Tripoli Level 1 High-Power Rocket Certification by designing, building, and launching a rocket powered by an H-class motor, reaching an altitude of approximately 2,000 ft while meeting all stability, recovery, and safety requirements.

I am currently working toward Tripoli Level 2 Certification, with my certification flight scheduled for an upcoming launch. Level 2 certification expands the allowable motor range to J, K, and L class motors (total impulses from 640 Ns to 5,120 Ns) and requires both a successful written examination covering high-power rocketry theory and safety, as well as a certified flight observed by Tripoli officials.

My Level 2 rocket is being designed and built to safely accommodate higher-impulse motors while maintaining robust structural integrity and predictable flight behavior. The vehicle incorporates a dedicated avionics bay with an altimeter and dual-deployment recovery system, enabling precise sequencing of drogue and main parachute deployment at target altitudes for controlled descent and safe recovery.

The Level 3 rocket will utilize a fiberglass airframe to provide high structural resilience while allowing uninterrupted GPS signal transmission through the vehicle body, critical for real-time flight tracking and post-flight recovery.

Throughout the design process, I use OpenRocket simulations to model flight dynamics, optimize stability margins, and verify deployment altitude parameters prior to launch, ensuring compliance with Tripoli safety codes and reliable flight performance.
